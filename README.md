My personal dotfiles

# On a new machine

1. Clone this repo inside your home directory
2. Change into the ```dotfiles``` directory and do the following:

```
# install all brew dependencies (Mac only)
brew bundle

# If installing for the first time (not on iPad instance)
make init

# copy dotfiles to the appropriate places
make
```
